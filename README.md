# clamav4pipeline
The `clamav4pipeline` is a command line tool which can be used to run ClamAV antivirus scan on top of specified directory.
The latest `clamav4pipeline` docker image contains latest virus database that is updated twice a day.

## Docker Image
The latest Docker image is located in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcollasarundell/clamav4pipeline). The image is rebuild and AV DB updated every day at 0:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC.
Check the last build [here.](https://github.com/luborpetr/clamav4pipeline/actions?query=workflow%3A%22AV+DB+Build%22+event%3Aschedule)

## Behaviour
When the `clamav4pipeline` is executed the scan progress is printed to the standard out.
Overall report is generated in specified directory at the end of the run.
The `clamav4pipeline` returns exit code `1` when there are infected files `0` otherwise.

## Usage
### Docker
```
# Directory to be scanned
SCAN_DIR=/tmp
# Output directory for the scanner log
OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp
docker run -v $SCAN_DIR/:/workdir/:ro \
           -v $OUTPUT_DIR/:/output/:rw \
           -it --rm kcollasarundell/clamav4pipeline:latest \
           scan.sh -d /workdir -l /output/log
